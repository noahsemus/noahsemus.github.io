            <p><i>brief:</i> design a brand or campaign that will address plastic pollution. do not use print communications.</p>

            <p class="projectDesc01">every day the US throws out 88 tons of plastic and it either goes to landfills or the ocean. the plastic never goes away. 17 million barrels of oil are used to make plastic water bottles every year<br><br>single-use plastics are more convenient. it adds extra strain to our lives to not use plastic. composting and recycling is seen as more complex and confusing.<br><br>basically plastic = bad</p>

            <p class="projectDesc01">most people already know about plastic pollution and the harm it is doing. how do we get them to act on their knowledge? present them with a problem and a solution. <br><br><i>problem:</i><br>earth is going to die no matter what. <br><br><i>solution:</i><br>we leave.</p>

            <p class="projectDesc02">leveraging the recent mars landing and the large amounts of press nasa and companies like spacex are recieving, i created a satirical game that will inform and take action.<br><br>the goal was to find a more enticing way to donate to plastic pollution.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="projectContent">
            <p class="projectDesc01"><i>thought process:</i> if most people already know about plastic pollution, they probably won't stop what they're doing to interact with plain information. therefore, we must insert ourselves into their daily routine when they have nothing better to do, i.e. on the subway platform.</p>

            <p class="projectDesc01">escape from earth is a pay to play arcade game. all the money goes to plastic pollution. the game will be seen through a classic-style arcade machine. the machine will be placed around subway stations on platforms for people to play.<br><br>these images were initial ideation for the machine. it was initially going to be space-aged as an attempt to connect to people's nostalgia. after user-testing, i found people connected more with the arcade machine aesthetic.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="projectContent">
            <p class="projectDesc01">the game is seen through a classic arcade machine and is set up in two distinct levels.<br><br><i>level one:</i><br>the player must escape earth while avoiding the polluted water and plastic waste left in humanity's wake.<br><br><i>level two:</i><br>the player is now in their ship, and must attempt to escape earth and head to mars.</p>

            <p class="projectDesc01">the style, much like the machine itself, is referencing classic arcade games. through research i found people would often be deterred from participating if they thought it was for some sort of cause, so the idea is to almost trick people into playing and ultimately donating to the cause.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="projectContent">
            <p class="projectDesc01">it is impossible to win escape from earth. after the loud and fast-paced gameplay, players are greeted with a sudden stop in sound and a message about plastic pollution; it is as if they are almost being zapped back into the real world.</p>

            <img src="/projectImages/cool/NYTMockbbig.png" class="contentImg02">
            <p class="projectDesc01">the game would hopefully get publicity thanks to the idea of tricking people into being good. the hypothesis is that the majority of people who play the game would, at first, not realise they are donating. however, after its initial launch, the media coverage would cause people to have this revelation and popularize the game even more.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="projectContent">
            <p class="projectDesc01">after the media coverage and subtle opening, communications would then be released to push the popularity and cultural impact at full blast.</p>

            <p class="projectDesc01">the best way to communicate the game was to actually build it. i built the alpha build in unity and was able to mock up the ui and other game components in post. you can play the game <a href="https://noahsemus.github.io/EFE_Level_1/">here</a>.<br><br><i>warning:</i> video has sound.</p>
