This idea takes a speculative look at the future and how technology integrates into our lives. When does it become so closely a part of us as a species that it reconnects into the human experience/ethos?"

Ultimately, none of them could live up to iMessage, but Google has had an ace up their sleeve the whole time... Chrome. I created this speculative app to explore the possibility of a unified Google Messaging Platform.
